# Bump
A super simple way to bump your package.json version numbers.

## How To Use:

To bump major:
	node bump.js major

To bump minor:
	node bump.js minor

To bump patch:
	node bump.js patch

To bump all of them:
	node bump.js major minor patch

## Notes:
There are lots of places where it could break. It's also not super customizable. I'm working on both of these things.

I'm also making it installable globally. But for now, it is not.
